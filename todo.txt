1. we need to authenitcate user, if they want to query or mutation some data
2. only check if they are authenticated if they try to query or mutation data
3. every sign in requires a new api key and token
4. use custom directive that allows you to simplify code
5. each query & mutation requires an api key or login user session because we can't allow unauthenticate user to use these 
6. allow guest to use some endpoint query & mutation
